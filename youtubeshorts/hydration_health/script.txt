Hook (0-2s):
Your health begins with how you treat your body before the first bite of food.

Core:
Drinking plain water is the lifeline of the human body.
It helps wake up your system, improves digestion, and keeps your mind fresh.
Start your morning with plain water, or water infused with ginger, mint, or coriander.
Make it a daily habit to drink 10–12 glasses of water to keep your body properly hydrated.
Drinking enough water:
Boosts energy and focus
Supports weight loss
Flushes out toxins
Keeps skin healthy and glowing
Aids digestion and overall body function
If you have any existing health conditions, always consult your doctor about your water intake.

End (CTA):
Hydration is not optional—it's essential.
Drink water daily, stay consistent, and let your body do the rest. 💧
